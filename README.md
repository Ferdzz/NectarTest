# Setup
1. Clone the project
2. Open the .xcproj file
3. Run the app through simulator, or change the signing and run on a physical device

# Remarks
The app is fairly basic. It's quick practice & challenge done in an afternoon. It displays a list of hives, allows for seeing the hive details and completely supports deletion, even offline. I'm no UI designer, so the interface is simple but functional. 

It supports iPhone used in prortrait mode.

This is not a fully polished project. A lot of improvements could be made but I haven't had the time to get around to all of them. I left TODOs throughout the code where relevant.
